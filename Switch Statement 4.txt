Problem statement:4
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.

Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.

There are 2 choices in the menu:
Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.

You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.

Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.
Example :
Input: ‘ch’ = 2 and ‘a’ = [3, 2]
Output: area = 6

Explanation: Since the choice ‘ch’ is 2, we have to print the area of the rectangle having ‘l’ = 3 and ‘b’ = 2, which is 6.

////////SOLUTION//////
public class Solution {
    public static double areaSwitchCase(int ch, double []a) {
        // double pi=3.14;
       switch(ch){
           //case 1 for the find the area of the circle
            case 1:
              double radius = a[0];
                return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
            

            //case 2 for the finding the area of the ractangle
            case 2:
                return a[0]*a[1];
            
            
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid input");
                 return -1;
       }
}
